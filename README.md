ofxReverb
=========

A wrapper that allows you to use the old school FreeVerb code in openFrameworks

This example uses ofxMaxim to load and play a sample It also uses ofxUI

So in order to play the example you will need to add the following addons.

-ofxReverb
-ofxXmlSettings
-ofxUI
-ofxMaxim

Thanks to Pierre Proske for helping me compile the original Freeverb code.
